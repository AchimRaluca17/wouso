## Hard rules

- always use an indentation of 4 spaces in your code
- new written code should always pass the [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) code linter. Run it using `pep8 wouso/core/qpool/models.py`
- make sure the tests pass locally using `./manage.py test`, before you make a pull request

## Guides

- try to follow the [Google Python style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html)
- follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
- read more about how to write good [commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
- before merging, ask for a code review from another contributor and check that your pull request has not broken the [continuous integration tests](https://travis-ci.org/rosedu/wouso)
